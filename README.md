packaging a microphone into a protocol buffer
===================================
steps are :
- listen:we spawn a child_process to start processes of recording from microphone
- using protocol buffer to wrap the microphone data as bytes and attach a userId to distinguish
 different users that are using our speech recognition API. passing id of the person to the class to make a unified message
-Now you can use any method such as kafka,ZMQ,streams,... to consume the data
